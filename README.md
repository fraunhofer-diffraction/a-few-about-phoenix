In 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_folklore" target="_blank" >Ancient Greek folklore</a>
, a phoenix (
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English" target="_blank" >/ˈfiːnɪks/</a>
; 
<!--Ancient Greek-->
: φοῖνιξ, phoînix) is a long-lived bird that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ash" target="_blank">ashes</a>
of its predecessor. Some legends say it dies in a show of flames and combustion, others that it simply dies and decomposes before being born again.
<a href="#1" id="one"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
Most accounts say that it lived for 500 years before rebirth.

<h2 id="Etymology"><center>Etymology</center></h2>
<hr>
The modern phoenix comes from Latin phoenīx via 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English" target="_blank">Old English</a>
. The Latin word comes from Greek 
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%86%CE%BF%E1%BF%96%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BE#Ancient_Greek" target="_blank">φοῖνιξ</a>
phoinīx.
<a href="#4" id="four"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
The Greek word is first attested in the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greek" target="_blank">Mycenaean</a>
Greek po-ni-ke, which probably meant '
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/griffin" target="_blank">griffin</a>
', though it might have meant 'palm tree'. That word is probably a borrowing from a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Semitic_languages" target="_blank">West Semitic</a>
word for 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubia" target="_blank">madder</a>
, a red dye made from 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubia_tinctorum" target="_blank">Rubia tinctorum</a>
. The word 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician" target="_blank">Phoenician</a>
appears to be from the same root, meaning 'those who work with red dyes'. So phoenix may mean 'the Phoenician bird' or 'the purplish-red bird'.

The spellings phœnix and phenix are rare nowadays.

<h2 id="Egyptian"><center>Egyptian origin hypothesis and the <i>Bennu</i></center></h2>
<hr>
Classical discourse on the subject of the phoenix points to a potential origin of the phoenix in 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" target="_blank">Ancient Egypt</a>
. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus" target="_blank">Herodotus</a>
, writing in the 5th century BC, gives a somewhat skeptical account of the phoenix. For example:

<blockquote>[The Egyptians] have also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I myself have never seen, except in pictures. Indeed it is a great rarity, even in Egypt, only coming there (according to the accounts of the people of Heliopolis) once in five hundred years, when the old phoenix dies. Its size and appearance, if it is like the pictures, are as follow:– The plumage is partly red, partly golden, while the general make and size are almost exactly that of the eagle. They tell a story of what this bird does, which does not seem to me to be credible: that he comes all the way from Arabia, and brings the parent bird, all plastered over with myrrh, to the temple of the Sun, and there buries the body. In order to bring him, they say, he first forms a ball of myrrh as big as he finds that he can carry; then he hollows out the ball and puts his parent inside, after which he covers over the opening with fresh myrrh, and the ball is then of exactly the same weight as at first; so he brings it to Egypt, plastered over as I have said, and deposits it in the temple of the Sun. Such is the story they tell of the doings of this bird.</blockquote>
<a href="#6" id="six"><sup>[6]</sup></a>

In the 19th century, scholastic suspicions appeared to be confirmed by the discovery that Egyptians in 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopolis_(ancient_Egypt)" target="_blank">Heliopolis</a> 
had venerated the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennu" target="_blank">Bennu</a>
, a solar bird similar in some respects to the Greek phoenix. However, the Egyptian sources regarding the bennu are often problematic and open to a variety of interpretations. Some of these sources may have actually been influenced by Greek notions of the phoenix, rather than the other way around.

<h2 id="Appearance"><center>Appearance</center></h2>
<hr>
The phoenix is sometimes pictured in ancient and medieval literature and medieval art as endowed with a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(optical_phenomenon)" target="_blank">halo</a>
, which emphasizes the bird's connection with the Sun.
<a href="#8" id="eighta"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
In the oldest images of phoenixes on record these nimbuses often have seven rays, like 
Helios
(the Greek personification of the Sun).
<a href="#9" id="nine"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
Pliny the Elder
<a href="#10" id="ten"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
also describes the bird as having a crest of feathers on its head,
<a href="#11" id="eleven"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
<a href="#8" id="eightb"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezekiel_the_Tragedian" target="_blank">Ezekiel the Dramatist</a>
compared it to a rooster.
<a href="#12" id="twelvea"><sup>[12]</sup></a>

Although the phoenix was generally believed to be colorful and vibrant, sources provide no clear consensus about its coloration. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus" target="_blank">Tacitus</a>
says that its color made it stand out from all other birds.
<a href="#13" id="thirteen"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
Some said that the bird had peacock-like coloring, and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus" target="_blank">Herodotus</a>
's claim of the Phoenix being red and yellow is popular in many versions of the story on record.
<a href="#14" id="fourteen"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
Ezekiel the Dramatist declared that the phoenix had red legs and striking yellow eyes,
<a href="#12" id="twelveb"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
but 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactantius" target="_blank">Lactantius</a>
said that its eyes were blue like sapphires
<a href="#15" id="fifteen"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
and that its legs were covered in yellow-gold scales with rose-colored talons.
<a href="#16" id="sixteen"><sup>[16]</sup></a>

Herodotus, Pliny, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Julius_Solinus" target="_blank">Solinus</a>
, and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philostratus" target="_blank">Philostratus</a>
describe the phoenix as similar in size to an eagle,
<a href="#17" id="seventeen"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
but Lactantius and Ezekiel the Dramatist both claim that the phoenix was larger, with Lactantius declaring that it was even larger than an ostrich.

<hr>
Ideas taking the phoenix into consideration presented themselves in the

manuscript 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of
_the_World" target="_blank">On the Origin of the World</a>
from the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nag_Hammadi_library" target="_blank">Nag Hammadi Library</a>

collection:
<pre>
    
    </pre>
<blockquote>Thus when 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve" target="_blank">Sophia Zoe</a>
saw that the rulers of darkness had laid a curse upon her counterparts, she was indignant. And coming out of the first heaven with full power, she chased those rulers out of their heavens and cast them into the sinful world, so that there they should dwell, in the form of evil spirits upon the earth. [...], so that in their world it might pass the thousand years in paradise - a soul-endowed living creature called "phoenix". It kills itself and brings itself back to life as a witness to the judgement against them, for they did wrong to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam" target="_blank">Adam</a>
and his race, unto the consummation of the age. There are [...] three men, and also his posterities, unto the consummation of the world: the spirit-endowed of eternity, and the soul-endowed, and the earthly. Likewise, there are three phoenixes in paradise - the first is immortal, the second lives 1,000 years; as for the third, it is written in the sacred book that it is consumed. So, too, there are three baptisms - the first is spiritual, the second is by fire, the third is by water. Just as the phoenix appears as a witness concerning thе <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel">angels</a>
, so the case of the water hydri in Egypt, which has been a witness to those going down into the baptism of a true man. The two bulls in Egypt posses a mystery, the Sun and the Moon, being a witness to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon_(Gnosticism)" target="_blank">Sabaoth</a>
: namely, that over them 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_(Gnosticism)" target="_blank">Sophia</a>
received the universe; from the day that she made the Sun and Moon, she put a seal upon her heaven, unto eternity. And the worm that has been born out of the phoenix is a human being as well. It is written concerning it, "the just man will blossom like a phoenix". And the phoenix first appears in a living state, and dies, and rises again, being a sign of what has become apparent at the consummation of the age.

As great in admiration as herself;
So shall she leave her blessedness to one,
When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,
Who from the sacred ashes of her honour
Shall star-like rise as great in fame as she was,
And so stand fix'd... </blockquote>
Phoenixes are present and relatively common in European
